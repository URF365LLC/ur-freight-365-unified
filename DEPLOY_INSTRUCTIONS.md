# UR Freight 365 Unified Site Deployment

This folder is the deployment-ready UR Freight 365 LLC site with a small Node/Express server for the freight assistant chat widget.

## Folder to deploy

Deploy this folder as the project root:

`ur-freight-365-unified/`

There is no build step. Railway should run `npm install` and start the app with `npm start`. The Express server serves the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/images and proxies chat requests.

## What is included

- `index.html` — gateway landing page with links to `/steel/`, `/produce/`, and `/logistics/`
- `steel/index.html` — steel and pipe division page
- `produce/index.html` — produce and reefer division page
- `logistics/index.html` — logistics, port, warehouse, cross-border, and last-mile page
- `privacy-policy.html` — shared privacy policy
- `terms.html` — shared terms and conditions
- `unsubscribe.html` — shared unsubscribe page
- `about.html`, `contact.html`, `quote.html`, `services.html` — shared supporting pages
- `vercel.json` — clean URL and HTML cache-header configuration
- `server.js` — Railway/Node server that reads `process.env.Ollama_URF365` for the chat widget API key
- `.env.example` — documents required and optional environment variables

## Railway environment variables

Set these in Railway before redeploying:

- `Ollama_URF365` — required API key for the Ollama/OpenAI-compatible freight assistant endpoint.
- `OLLAMA_ENDPOINT` — optional override for the chat completions endpoint.
- `OLLAMA_MODEL` — optional model override; defaults to `llama3.2`.

Do not commit a real API key. The server reads `process.env.Ollama_URF365` and keeps the key out of browser JavaScript.
